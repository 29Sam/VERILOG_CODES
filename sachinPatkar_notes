1)Gray code is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit). 
they can solve error problem since on transition from one number to the next only differs in 1bit has to be observed 

2)Conversion Rules:
Binary → Gray
G3 = B3
G2 = B3 ⊕ B2
G1 = B2 ⊕ B1
G0 = B1 ⊕ B0
Gray → Binary
B3 = G3
B2 = G3 ⊕ G2
B1 = G3 ⊕ G2 ⊕ G1
B0 = G3 ⊕ G2 ⊕ G1 ⊕ G0
hence ,MSB remains same in both conversions; other bits derived by XOR relations.
